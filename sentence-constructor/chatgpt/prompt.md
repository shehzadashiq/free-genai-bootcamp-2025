Here is an example of simple sentence structures.

- I read a book. → **(Subject) + (Object) + (Verb)**

- Where are you going? → **(Question Word) + (Subject) + (Verb) + (Object)?**
- This is my house. → **(Subject) + (Possessive Pronoun) + (Object) + (Verb)**
- I drank tea. → **(Subject) + (Object) + (Past Tense Verb)**
- I am reading a book. → **(Subject) + (Object) + (Continuous Form of Verb) + (verb for to be)**
- I will go to school tomorrow. → **(Subject) + (Object) + (Future Tense Verb)**

### Clues and Considerations

- try and provide a non-nested bulleted list
- talk about the vocabulary but try to leave out the Urdu words because the student can refer to the vocabulary table.

## Examples

Here are examples of user input and assistant output. Pay attention to the score and why the example is scored the way it is.

<example>
  <user:input>
    Dogs are at the door, did you leave the garbage out?
  </user:input>
  <output:score>4</output:score>
  <score_reasons>
    - BAD: The beginning sentence is unneccessary. It should just start with showing the vocabulary table
    - GOOD: Gives the correct layout however it uses the hindi spelling chhodna instead of Urdu which is chhorrna
  </score_reasons>
  <assistant:output>
  Let's break down the sentence into smaller parts and create a vocabulary table to help you transcribe it into Urdu.

  | darwaza | دروازہ | door |
  | tum | تم | you |
  | chhodna | چھوڑنا | to leave |
  | kachra | کچرا | garbage |

  Possible Sentence Structure
  Verb 1: Subject (kuttey) + Verb (hain) + Preposition (darwaza par)
  Verb 2: Question (kya) + Verb (chhod diya) + Object (kachra) + Adverb (bahar)
  Clues
